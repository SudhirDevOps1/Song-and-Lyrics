## 1. 🎥 Native Video Export & Smart Cropping Engine
- Engineered a fully automated, native browser video export system using `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia`.

- Rewrote the core timeline engine, upgrading it from a `setInterval` 20Hz loop to a mathematically precise `requestAnimationFrame` 60/120Hz display sync loop.
- Added hardware-accelerated CSS `will-change: transform, opacity` properties to the lyric engine, moving blur/scaling calculations to the GPU for flawless zero-lag scrolling.

## 5. 💎 Ultra-Premium Glassmorphism UI
- Upgraded the workspace UI by applying deep `backdrop-filter: blur(30px)`, glowing semi-transparent borders, and soft shadows to the sidebars and editor panels, mimicking top-tier $100/mo SaaS applications.

- Automatically hides the left and right sidebars dynamically to provide a true distraction-free recording space.
- Designed CSS-based hardware volume and power buttons, a dynamic island/notch, and a home swipe indicator.

## 2. 🎨 Premium Audio Spectrum Engine
- Completely overhauled the audio visualizer engine to support 5 distinct, industry-standard modes: `Apple (Smooth Curve)`, `DJ (Segmented Spectrum)`, `Radial (Circular Bar)`, `Retro (Hollow Synthwave)`, and `Immersive (Bars + Glowing Particles)`.
- Introduced a dynamic time-shifting rainbow HSL gradient to all visualizers for stunning color transitions.

- Included `+0.5s` and `-0.5s` bulk timeline offset adjustment buttons.

## 4. 🎛️ Drag-to-Scrub Timeline Engine
- Upgraded the player progress bar to support **smooth mouse/touch drag scrubbing**.

## 5. 💖 Smart Duet & Layout Polish
- Engineered automated duet/chorus highlighting: any lyrics wrapped in parenthesis `(like this)` are automatically rendered in a distinct Rose Pink color.
- Converted `.main` grid container to a responsive Flexbox constraint to permanently eliminate UI overlapping bugs on small browser windows.

# 🌟 Features Added (v6 Heart Wave)

## 1. 🫀 Heart Wave Mathematical Loader
- Integrated a purely mathematical SVG animation loader based on the formula `f(x) = |x|^(2/3) + 0.9√(3.3 - x²) sin(6.4πx)`.
- Features 102 individual dynamic SVG particles spinning seamlessly via `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Displays as a gorgeous, blurred overlay above the lyrics visualizer specifically when the YouTube API is buffering or transitioning between tracks.
